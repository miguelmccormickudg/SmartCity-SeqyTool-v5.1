<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
SmartCity SeqyTool v5.1 (“the Tool”) is an open-source digital platform designed to evaluate and benchmark the territorial intelligence and smart city maturity of municipalities and institutions. 
UrbanLab Facta Terrae acts as a <strong>Data Processor</strong> and operates solely on behalf of participating entities (“Data Controllers”), such as municipalities, public institutions, or universities that use the Tool for self-assessment purposes.

</p>

<h2>3. Data Processed</h2>
<p>
The Tool primarily processes non-personal, aggregated, or anonymized information related to smart city indicators, including but not limited to: governance, digital infrastructure, mobility, environment, and social inclusion metrics. 
All inputs are provided voluntarily by institutional users for diagnostic and analytical purposes. No biometric, sensitive, or personal identifiers are required or requested.
