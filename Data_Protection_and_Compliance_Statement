UrbanLab Facta Terrae acts as the <strong>Data Processor</strong>, managing technical infrastructure and security mechanisms. 
Participating entities (municipalities, universities, or organizations) act as <strong>Data Controllers</strong>, retaining ownership and full responsibility over their data. 
Controllers determine the purpose and scope of the assessment, while UrbanLab ensures compliance and technical safeguards as outlined in this statement.

This ensures compliance with Articles 5 and 25 of the GDPR and Articles 6 and 13 of the LGPD regarding data minimization and privacy by design.
</p>

<h2>7. Consent Management</h2>

Whenever identifiable information (e.g., contact details from institutional representatives) may be collected, explicit informed consent is obtained before submission. 
Consent requests clearly state the purpose, retention period, and rights of the data subject. 
Users may withdraw consent at any time by contacting <a href="mailto:hola@factaterrae.com">hola@factaterrae.com</a>, after which all related information will be deleted.
